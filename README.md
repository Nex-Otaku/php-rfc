# php-rfc

## Purpose
Make discussions about PHP RFC opened to community feedback. 

## Rules
1. Anybody can post his own RFC draft, just create an issue
2. Existing "official" RFCs can be posted as well
3. One RFC = One issue
4. Be polite or be banned

## Why
We strive to provide valuable feedback about RFCs to move PHP forward. 
Mailing list for this purpose is not good enough.
